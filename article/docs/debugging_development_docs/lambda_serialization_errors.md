# Error Documentation: ValueError: Cannot serialize function: lambda

#### Description:
The error **`ValueError: Cannot serialize function: lambda`** in Django occurs during instances when the framework encounters a lambda function in a context which requires serialization like migrations or in handling model instances in a queryset.

#### Context:
This was achieved through running the following command:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```


### Error snippet

``` bash
  File "$cwd/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/django/db/migrations/serializer.py", line 216, in serialize
    return self.serialize_deconstructed(path, args, kwargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "$cwd/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/django/db/migrations/serializer.py", line 94, in serialize_deconstructed
    arg_string, arg_imports = serializer_factory(arg).serialize()
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/$cwd/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/django/db/migrations/serializer.py", line 161, in serialize
    raise ValueError("Cannot serialize function: lambda")
```

Traceback showed Django couldn't serialize a lambda function, which had been set as the default value for the `author` field of `Article` model.

#### Steps Attempted:
1. **Locate the Source of the Error**:
   - Went over the traceback to find out what kind of lambda function was offending the `Article` model.
   - Found that `author` field utilizes a lambda function to set its default to the first instance of `Profile`.

2. **Remove Lambda Function:
- Removed the lambda function inside the `author` field definition and used the direct reference of the `ForeignKey` in its place.

   **Old Code:**
   ```python
   author = models.ForeignKey(Profile, blank=True, null=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=lambda: Profile.objects.first())
   ```

   **New Code:**
   ```python
   author = models.ForeignKey(Profile, blank=True, null=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
   ```

3. **Run the Migration Command Again:
Having altered the model, reran the command to do the migrations, by:
 - 
```
python manage.py makemigrations
```

#### Solution:
 I had managed to avoid the error in serialization. That was due to removing the lambda function from the default value of `author` field. The definitions of the models were correct from Django's viewpoint, hence I was able to execute the migrations without any further errors.

#### Effervescence:
This process brought out the importance of adhering to Django recommendations in defining model fields. Using lambda functions for defaults contributed a lot towards serialization and also in contributing better maintainability and readability of code.
